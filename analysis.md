# Course Shop

## Problem Statement:

In this assignment, you will create a web application for showcasing a list
of courses and their details using React. Your task is to implement the
course listing page, a course details page, and a student dashboard to
display enrolled courses. Additionally, you may attempt bonus tasks
marked withüéÅfor showcasing proficiency.

## Frontend Requirements:

**Course Listing:** Create a page to showcase list of courses

1. Fetch a list of sample courses (use a dummy api or readymade backends like
   firebase).
2. Display the courses in a scrollable list with basic information and enable searching
   based on course name and instructor (e.g., course name, instructor, etc.).
3. Users should be able to click on a course to view its details.

**Course Details Screen:** Create a new screen that displays detailed information about a
selected course. This screen should be accessible from the course listing screen.
Use the sample course model provided as a reference for the structure of course data.
Display Course Information:

Display the following course information on the details screen (as described in the previous
assignment):

1. Course name
2. Instructor's name
3. Description
4. Enrollment status (e.g., 'Open', 'Closed', 'In Progress')
5. Course duration
6. Schedule
7. Location
8. Pre-requisites
9. Syllabus as an expandable item

## Student Dashboard:

1. Create a user dashboard for students to display the courses they are enrolled in.
   Include a user-friendly interface with a list of enrolled courses.
2. Display course name, instructor name, thumbnail, due date, and a progress bar.
3. Implement a feature that allows students to mark courses as completed.
   Advanced State Management:
   Utilize a state management library such as Redux or MobX to manage the application's state
   effectively.

## Backend Requirements

**Create a Retrieve Course List API:**

1. Create an API endpoint that returns a list of sample courses. You can use dummy
   data stored on the server.
2. The API response should provide basic information for each course, including
   course name, instructor name, and other relevant details.

**Create a Retrieve API for Course Details:**

1. Create an API endpoint that returns a details of a particular course.
2. The API endpoint should provide basic and relevant infromation for the
   particular course mentioned above.

**API for Enroll in a Course:**

1. Create an API endpoint that allows students to enroll in a course. The API should
   accept the student's user ID and the course identifier as parameters.
2. Ensure that a student cannot enroll in the same course multiple times.

**Retrieve Enrolled Courses:**

1. Implement an API endpoint that returns a list of courses in which a student
   is enrolled.
2. The response should include course name, instructor name, a course
   thumbnail, due date, and a progress status for each enrolled course.

**Mark Courses as Completed:**

1. Create an API endpoint that allows students to mark a course as completed. The
   API should accept the student's user ID and the course identifier.
2. Ensure that a student can only mark a course as completed if they are enrolled
   in it.

**Course Details for Dashboard:**

1. Implement an API endpoint to provide detailed information about a specific
   course for the student's dashboard.
2. The API should accept the student's user ID and the course identifier as
   parameters.
3. Ensure that students can only access the details of courses they are enrolled
   in.

**User Authentication:**

1. Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized students can access
   the dashboard, enroll in courses, and mark them as completed
2. Secure API endpoints to require authentication and authorization checks.

**Pagination:**

1. Implement pagination for the course list API to limit the number of courses returned
   per request. Include options to specify the page number and the number of courses
   per page.

**Search Options:**

1. Create an API endpoint that allows students to search for courses based on
   specific criteria, including but not limited to course name, instructor name, or
   keywords related to the course.
2. The API should accept search parameters in the request, and the search should
   be case-insensitive, meaning it should match courses regardless of letter case.
3. Provide optional advanced search options, such as filtering courses by
   enrollment status (e.g., 'Open,' 'Closed,' 'In Progress') or by course duration.
4. Allow students to customize their search to find courses that match their specific
   needs.

**Notes:**

1. Properly document the API, providing clear and concise information on how
   to use each endpoint.
2. Implement robust error handling to manage various scenarios, such as
   unauthorized access or enrolling in non-existent courses.
3. If you choose to use a database to store course and enrollment data, ensure
   that the database is set up and accessible for testing purposes(Use Docker to
   ensure this).
