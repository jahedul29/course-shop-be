## How to run the application :

I used latest node version while developing the application `18.16.0` and used yarn for managing dependencies

1. Clone the application
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jahedul29/course-shop-be
   ```
2. install required dependencies using yarn
   `yarn`
3. Then migrate prisma
   `npx prisma migrate dev`
4. Run the application
   `yarn dev`
5. To check the prisma studio, run
   `npx prisma studio`
   then prisma studio can be accessible from http://localhost:5555
